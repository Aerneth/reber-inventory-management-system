# Reber Inventory Management System (RIMS)

A **console-based inventory management system** built in C#. This project is designed to help manage and track items in my electronics workshop with plans for features such as adding, viewing, editing, and removing inventory items. 

This project is a work in progress and will gradually include more functionality as my C# skills advance.
