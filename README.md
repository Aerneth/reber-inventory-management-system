# Reber Inventory Management System (RIMS)

A **console-based inventory management system** built in C#. This project is designed to help manage and track items in my electronics workshop with plans for features such as adding, viewing, editing, and removing inventory items. 

This project is a work in progress and will gradually include more functionality as my C# skills advance.

Created with assitance from ChatGPT AI.

## Scope

While this is a learning project, the intent is for it to be functional. That being said, this inventory management system's intended scope is a one-person, hobbyist workshop. The database associated with the project is SQLite. There aren't plans to make this connect to a remote database. The resulting app is intended to be run on a local computer and will not natively have any support for remote connections. If you use this app in _your_ personal workshop or what-have-you, I would suggest being careful of data loss in the event of a drive failure. This software comes as-is without warranty - see the LICENSE file. There will be bugs, I likely won't catch them, and they likely won't be fixed unless you fork the repository and fix them yourself. I wouldn't suggest using this for a business or anywhere money is on the line.
